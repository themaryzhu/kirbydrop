*Note: this was the bare bones initial proposal we came up with, which changed significantly through the course of the project's development

Here is a suggested outline for your proposal. You don't need to follow this
outline, but it may help you focus your project.

* Project title: Reverse Doodle Jump (we'll come up with a snazzier title)
* Team members: Andrea Dahl, Mary Zhu
* Description (1 pp describing the basic idea): We will be creating a game, where the user controls a ball that starts at the top of a graphics window and must land on any of a series of platforms spaced throughout the screen that are moving up. The player loses if the ball goes out of bounds through either the top or bottom window. The ball's motion will controlled using the gyrescope components of a Raspberry Pi Sense HAT (which will be used like a hand-held controller), while the graphics will be generated using our own graphics library. We plan to make the game progressively more difficult to play by tampering with the speed of the scrolling platforms and/or by introducing new obstacles. If time permits, we will also tamper with the button and LED light display components of the Sense HAT. 
* Hardware required (itemize what hardware, if any, you need): Raspberry Pi Sense HAT
* Funds requested (the amount you will want to be reimbursed, remember you have
a $20 budget per person): Raspberry Pi Sense HAT: $37.83
* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task: We plan to tag-team this project by keeping each other updated on which components we are currently working ond and communicating to get through hurdles. We will take turns consulting TAs for help in OH if necessary. 
* Goals for next week: Our goal is to complete all graphics and to get started on implementing the sensor features of the Sense HAT by next week (the Sense HAT is still being shipped to us).

Keep the proposal short and to the point.

We suggest you try to get all the major hardware components working by the
first week. That will leave the following week for putting the components
together into a working system.
